I would like to be able surf on the internet with a better understanding of the risks and inner working of the system.
I would also like to be able to surf more freely and quite honestly to be able to bypass some levels of security I might encounter. For rather innocent reasons of course.
I'd enjoy finding a job in cybersecurity and have heard that big companies were offering bounties for finding and reporting security issues. That sounds kindof fun and might be a worthwile sidejob.
This should be enought for the purposes of this exercise shouldn't it ?
